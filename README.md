# FizzBuzz

I decided to create this repository after reading through [Minimum Viable Test by Chris Hartjes](https://leanpub.com/minimumviabletests). I've not done a lot of deliberate code katas for some time. So felt that it'd be good to get in and do some. Plus I haven't implemented this algorithm before. It's just a basic implementation, nothing special, but tidy.

## Install

If you want to check it out and use it, just:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `composer test`
